\# 💸 Tip Calculator



A simple and useful Python program designed to help you calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill at a restaurant, including the tip.



\## 📝 About the Project



This project solves a common real-world problem: splitting the bill! It takes the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people, then calculates the exact amount each person needs to contribute.



It is built to practice \*\*mathematical operations\*\*, \*\*data type conversion\*\*, and \*\*f-string formatting\*\* in Python.



\## 🚀 How to Run



1\. Clone this repository:

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  git clone \[https://github.com/eniscelik16/tip-calculator.git](https://github.com/eniscelik16/tip-calculator.git)



2\. Navigate to the Project directory:

&nbsp;  cd tip-calculator



3\. Run the script:

&nbsp;  python main.py



\## 🎮 Usage Example

When you run the program, it will ask for three inputs:



Welcome to the Tip Calculator!

What was the total bill?

$ 150

How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?

$ 12

How many people will split the bill?

$ 5



\## Output:

Each person should pay: $ 33.60



\## 🛠️ Technologies \& Concepts

Python 3



Input Function: Handling user data.



Type Conversion: Converting strings to floats and integers (float(), int()).



Mathematical Operations: Percentage calculations.



F-Strings: For precise string formatting (limiting to 2 decimal places).
